# My Cybersecurity Home Lab
This repo documents my home lab journey as I break into cybersecurity. I'm starting from scratch and using this space to track my tools, notes, and progress.

## Tools I Plan to Use
- VirtualBox or VMware
- Kali Linux
- Ubuntu or Windows 10 VM
- TryHackMe
- Wireshark
- Nmap
- Burp Suite

## Skills I Want to Build
- Network scanning and enumeration
- Vulnerability exploration (safely, in my lab, of course!)
- Web app testing
- Packet Analysis
- Scripting (PowerShell, Bash, Python basics)

## My Learning Progress
Date| Activity | Notes

TBD | Started lab setup |

## Why I Made This
I want to show my dedication to building cybersecurity skills through hands-on practice, not just coursework or certs. This repo will grow with me.
